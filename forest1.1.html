                  The people living in and around Sundarbans are mainly dependent on collection of non-timber forest produce such as wild honey , fuelwood,thatching materials.
                  Besides their other livelihood means include -- timbers, fishing and collection of gastropods.

                   Collection of wild honey in the wildness of Sundarbans is one of the main livelihood in this region and the people indulging in the same are locally called mouals.  -->
                   <!--  Other livelihood options in this area are collection of timber, fuelwood, and thatching materials, fishing and collection of gastropods. -->
                   
                  </p>
                <br/><br/>
                <p>Shifting agriculture is also practiced in this area.

<p>However, these professions pose risk of the highest order as the villagers are frequently attacked by tigers and other wild animals.
Previously, masks were worn by the villagers on the rear side while entering the forest as tigers tend to attack from the back.
However, with time this trick has ceased to bluff the tiger.

There is also a conflict between the officials responsible for protecting the forest and villagers who collect non-timber forest produce perpetually.
By virtue of it being a biosphere reserve, there are stringent rules and regulations in Sundarbans that put restrictions on collection of NTFP. 
These restrictions are of various kinds, and apply on the number of issued permits as well as permitting entry only to the buffer area of the Sundarbans Tiger Reserve.
However, in certain cases such as honey gathering, fishing and crab fishing, which typically involve animals, relaxations have been made in the rules.  -->
</p><br/><br/> <p> In general, collection of such forest products are dependent on specific areas—they are predominant in the eastern part of the biosphere reserve.

<!--  The collection of forest products is extremely dangerous.  -->
Villagers face threats from man-eating tigers and crocodiles. -->
Villagers don’t even have any insurance policies, and claim for compensation is also a lengthy process.
In case of incidents that happen inside the core area, they cannot claim compensation.
 The core zone is strictly banned for the collection of forest products. 
 However, due to unsustainable harvesting and collection of the riverine species, their population in the buffer zone has gone down considerably, because of which the villagers have no option left but to enter the core zone. 
 They take this risk to find resources for their survival and have often fallen victim to human-animal conflict.
